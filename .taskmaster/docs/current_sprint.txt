Goal: Make mobile friendly (touch and performance), replace 3d layers with a layer containing only an svg of the model (+ maybe light blob?).
Goal: Performance improvements and optimizations without taking away from beautiful rendering.
Specifics:
- Check codebase for mesh code (e.g. create_sphere_mesh) - remove if possible/unused.
- Check for unnecessary rust imports like loggers and very old/outdated crates.
- Develop a strategy for low and high power devices using deviceStore.
- Fallback strategy for low power: rendering merely SVG files of the corresponding model.
- Optimize use of service workers.
- Bug fix: Shown time should accurately reflect the current time (currently rounds to full hours).
- Cleanup: Check if audio_store is redundant after removing iamf.
